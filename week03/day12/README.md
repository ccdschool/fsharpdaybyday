# Day #12 - Pattern matching
Today you'll learn about one of the most important features of any Functional Programming language: pattern matching.

You can start out using pattern matching as a replacement for the _if-then-else_ function. Or you can view it as a sophisticated _switch_. But it's much more. It's more like a built in rules engine.

Pattern matching is used in several places in F#. But the most prominent one is the _match_ expression.

### Value matching
_if_ is some sort of very simple pattern matching.

```fsharp
if answer=42 then 
    printfn "Question unknown!"
else 
    printfn "You know the question"
```

It checks whether a value matches one of the value patterns _true_ or _false_. The same can be done with _match_:

```fsharp
match answer=42 with
| true -> printfn "Question unknown!"
| false -> printfn "You know the question"
```

The general form of a _match_ expression is

```fsharp
match someValue with
| pattern1 -> expression1
| pattern2 -> expression2
...
```

_match_ compares a given value to a list of patterns which match the type of the value. Above the value's type is _bool_ so the patterns are of type _bool_, too.

Think of the vertical bar as an or-operator. This becomes even more obvious when you see that patterns can be written one after another, if they should be handled by the same expression:

```fsharp
match someValue with
| pattern1 | pattern1a | pattern1b -> expression1
| pattern2 | pattern2a | pattern2b -> expression2
...
```

If a pattern matches the value its expression gets evaluated. Of course all expressions must return the same type of data.

Patterns can be constant values like _true_ and _false_. _And the list of patterns needs to be exaustive!_ That means: all possible values need to be covered by at least one pattern. For a given value of type _bool_ that's only _true_ and _false_. But what, if _match_ was to compare patterns to just _answer_?

> *sadly* they need not be exhaustive (you only get a warning)

```fsharp
match answer with
| 42 -> printfn "Question unknown!"
| _ -> printfn "You know the question"
```

In this case the _ placeholder is a catch all pattern. Which means you need to be careful about the order in which you list the patterns:

```fsharp
match answer with // does not compile
| _ -> printfn "You know the question"
| 42 -> printfn "Question unknown!"
```

This is syntactically correct - but not semantically. The compiler will reject it, since the obvious catch all pattern would block further patterns from being checked. 

> again (did you fiddle with your warning settings?) this will be accepted by the compiler (as you sayed so first too) - it should only generate a warning

_So be sure to order the patterns from specific to general._

> or better avoid overlap (yeah nobody does this - but if you want to argue about your programm it's a good idea ;) )

But _match_ is more than the _switch_ you know from other languages. _match_ does not only work for scalar types. You can use it with collection types and structured types, too.

You can check for a certain tuple:

```fsharp
let p = "Mary", 42

match p with
| "Peter", 23 -> ...
| "Mary", 42 -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

Or you can check for a particular record:

```fsharp
type Person = {Name:string; Age:int}

let p = {Name="Peter"; Age=23}

match p with
| {Name="Peter"; Age=23} -> ...
| {Name="Mary"; Age=42} -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

Or select a list according to its element values:

```fsharp
let l = [2; 4; 6]

match l with
| [] -> ... // checkf for empty list
| [2; 4; 6] -> ...
| [1; 3; 5] -> ...
| _ -> ...
```

### Structure matching
This is pretty nifty already, but _match_ can do even more. So far you've seen value patterns: a given value is compared to other values, the patterns.

> this is not only for `match` ... deconstruction will work almost everywhere: `let`, in parameters (you already used it somewhere in the other lessons), ...

Often, though, the pieces of a structure or collection value are not known (or are not important). Rather you're interested in it's structure. Take a list for example. How do you decompose a list? You can do it like this:

```fsharp
let head = l.Head
let tail = l.Tail
```

But what do you do if the list is empty? It's important to take that into account and check for it. There won't be a head in an empty list. That's why the compiler issues a warning when you try to do it like this:

```fsharp
let head :: tail = l // compiler warning issued!
```

This is a simple form of pattern matching, too. Like decomposition of a tuple is:

```fsharp
let p = ("Mary", 42)
let name, age = p
```

The structure on the left side of the = must match the structure of the value on the right side.

So how to decompose a list safely? _match_ to the rescue:

```fsharp
match l with
| [] -> ...
| head :: tail -> printfn "%d - %A" head tail
```

Instead of making the pattern an exact value you just describe the structure you're looking for using placeholders.

Those placeholders then are bound to the values found in the given value in the places they represent. You can use them on the right side of the -> operator.

Here's how you can react to persons with certain characteristics using placeholders:

```fsharp
match p with
| {Name="Peter"; Age=a} -> printfn "Peter is %d years old" a
| {Name=n; Age=42} -> printfn "Name of 42 year old is %s" n
| _ -> printfn "Not interested"
```

Or try to group the elements in a list in a pairwise manner, i.e. [2; 4; 6] would lead to [(2,4); (6;8)]. Here's how to do it with _match_:

```fsharp
let even = [2; 4; 6]

let pair l =
    let rec pair' l r =
        match l with
        | [] -> r
        | [x] -> (x,x) :: r
        | x :: y :: tail -> pair' tail ((x,y) :: r)
    pair' l [] |> List.rev

printfn "%A" (pair even)
```

Of course the list is processed recursively. On each recursion the remaining list is checked for certain structural patterns: is it empty, or does it only contain a single element, or does it contain at least two elements (plus maybe some more)?

If there are at least two elements in the list they are combined into a tuple and prepended to the resulting list of pairs (parameter r).

(Prepending (_(x,y) :: r_) might be a bit more natural than appending (_r @ [(x,x)]_) since result r is already a list; but then the result has to be inverted at the end. On the other hand appending requires a tad less code. You choose ;-)

> Also `@` has a really ugly runtime cost - in this case you have to recreate/iterate over all of `r`

### Conditional matching
So far pattern matching works based on structure and exact values. But what if the cases should be distinguished where the structure is the same, but the values differ? Take for example the "FizzBuzz" kata again.

Using _if-then-else_ the comparison looks like this:

```fsharp
let fizzbuzz i =
    if i % 3 = 0 && i % 5 = 0 then
        "fizzbuzz"
    else if i % 3 = 0 then
        "fizz"
    else if i % 5 = 0 then
        "buzz"
    else
        i.ToString()
```

For each case there is a special expression.

This can be done using _match_ too using guarded matches with _when_:

```fsharp
let fizzbuzz i =
    match i with
    | x when x % 3 = 0 && x % 5 = 0 -> "fizzbuzz"
    | x when x % 3 = 0 -> "fizz"
    | x when x % 5 = 0 -> "buzz"
    | x -> x.ToString()

```

Do a structure match and then add a conditional expression after _when_ to work with the pattern placeholders.

Of course this can be done in an even more readable manner:

```fsharp
let is_fizz i = i % 3 = 0
let is_buzz i = i % 5 = 0
let is_fizzbuzz i = (is_fizz i) && (is_buzz i)

let fizzbuzz i =
    match i with
    | x when is_fizzbuzz x -> "fizzbuzz"
    | x when is_fizz x -> "fizz"
    | x when is_buzz x -> "buzz"
    | x -> x.ToString()
```

With guarded or conditional matches _match_ truely becomes the decision making workhorse feature of F#. Once you get the hang of it you'll find you'll use _if-then-else_ less and less. It will become more of just a ternary operator used in expressions, e.g.

```fsharp
let line' = line + (if line = "" then "" else ",") + word
```

### Shortcut
Since _match_ is used so frequently it should come as no surprise that there is a shortcut for it. If you find yourself defining a function just for the purpose of doing a match like _fizzbuzz_ above, then you can shorten it like this:

```fsharp
let fizzbuzz = function
    | x when is_fizzbuzz x -> "fizzbuzz"
    | x when is_fizz x -> "fizz"
    | x when is_buzz x -> "buzz"
    | x -> x.ToString()
```

You can drop the singe function parameter as well as _match-with_. Instead write _function_ after the = of a _let_ binding followed by the patterns.

This kind of match-function can be used wherever a function value (lambda expression) is allowed, e.g.

```fsharp
[(1,2);(2,2);...] |> List.filter (function x,y when x=y -> true | _ -> false)
```

As you can see, even the vertical bar before the first pattern can be dropped.

Unfortunately the _function_ shortcut may not be used for functions with more than one parameter like the recursive _pair'_ above.

> it can if you remember that functions are curried anyway ;)

***

Pattern matching is one of the core features of functional languages. At first it might look a bit strange with all the syntax details - but soon you'll get the hang of it.

Just think of it as a function switchboard. Structural patterns almost look like anonymous functions. Compare for example

```
match a with
| x, y -> ...
...
```

to

```
fun x, y -> ... 
```
